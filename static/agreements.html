        <h2>Open Source</h2>
        <h3>No one owns it! No one can make money off of it.</h3>
        <p>A common approach to hackathons is to create open source software. There are various types of open source software, but the underlying principle is that the software will be open to use, modification, and copying by anyone at no cost. This model keeps proprietary issues at bay because neither the host, nor the participant, (nor anyone else) can sell the software. This obviously has pros and cons outside of legal considerations, such as making a valuable product available to the public for free.</p>

        <p>If the intent of a hackathon is to create open source software, then that intention should be contractually specified and memorialized. A clear contract guarantees that a participant cannot argue that they maintained a proprietary interest in the software and try to sell it on their own (or worse, sue the hackathon host for using their proprietary software).</p>

        <p>I/O has used this type of agreement for their hackathon.</p>

        <h2>Negotiated Ownership</h2>
        <h3>Depending on how things turn out, the host/sponsor will decide if they want to own any of it. If that’s the plan, they have 3 binding agreements they can choose from</h3>
        <p>An agreement does not have to be legally binding, but could simply be a way of formally telling the participants that the hackathon host is potentially interested in marketing their creation. However, there are three special types of binding agreements involving a potential sale or negotiation that a host might want to consider.</p>

        <p>Condé Nast International Hackathon has used this type of agreement for their hackathon.</p>

        <h2 class="second">Right of First Option</h2>
        <h3>Host gets to decide if they want to buy it or not before anyone else has the option.</h2>
        <p>This agreement gives the host the first opportunity to purchase the participant's work product. For example, having two weeks to decide whether to buy the work product or not, after which point there would be a right to negotiate with the participant for a product license (as opposed to owning the software flat out).</p>

        <h2 class="second">Right of First Negotiation</h2>
        <h3>Host and participant just need to have a chat in a good faith about the possibility of a sale.</h2>
        <p>This agreement typically requires the parties to have a good faith negotiation with one another before they go to the open market.  Note that there is no requirement that the parties reach an agreement, but rather merely that they make a good faith effort.</p>

        <h2 class="second">Right of First Refusal</h2>
        <h3>If a third party offers to buy the participant's product, the host can match that offer before the participant can agree to sell it. If the host matches the offer, the host wins.</h2>
        <p>This agreement covers situations involving a third party offer who wants to buy the participant's work product. With this type of agreement in place, if a third party makes an offer to purchase the work product, the hose would get an opportunity to match the third party's offer before the participant would be allowed to sell the work product. If the host matches the third party's offer, the participant is required to make the sale to the host instead of to the third party.</p>

        <h2>Shared Ownership</h2>
        <h3>The host owns some, the participant owns some.</h3>

        <p>An agreement that sets out the percentage or finite dollar amount that the party would receive for a right to any featyre sales of a work product from the hackathon. The agreement could include a provision allowing the participant to market the software and then pay a set amount to the host; or alternatively the agreement could allow the host to market the product and then pay a set amount to the paricipant. An example of this would be an agreement promising to give a participant 50% of any future profits made on the sale of the software. This type of agreement would entail many business decisions for the host to consider, namely financial equity and how percentages of royalties, profits, etc. would work practically.</p>
